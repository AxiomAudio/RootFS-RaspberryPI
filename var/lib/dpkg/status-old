Description: Package Discovery and Resource Access using pkg_resources
 The pkg_resources module provides an API for Python libraries to
 access their resource files, and for extensible applications and
 frameworks to automatically discover plugins.  It also provides
 runtime support for using C extensions that are inside zipfile-format
 eggs, support for merging packages that have separately-distributed
 modules or subpackages, and APIs for managing Python's current
 "working set" of active packages.

Description: configuration for the Exim MTA (v4)
 Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-config provides the configuration
 for the exim4 daemon packages. The configuration framework has been split
 off the main package to allow sites to replace the configuration scheme
 with their own without having to change the actual exim4 packages.
 .
 Sites with special configuration needs (having a lot of identically
 configured machines for example) can use this to distribute their own
 custom configuration via the packaging system, using the magic
 available with dpkg's conffile handling, without having to do local
 changes on all of these machines.
 .
 The Debian exim4 packages have their own web page,
 http://wiki.debian.org/PkgExim4. There is also a Debian-specific
 FAQ list. Information about the way the Debian packages are
 configured can be found in
 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz, which additionally contains
 information about the way the Debian binary packages are built. The
 very extensive upstream documentation is shipped in
 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/spec.txt.gz. To repeat the debconf-driven
 configuration process in a standard setup, invoke dpkg-reconfigure
 exim4-config. There is a Debian-centered mailing list,
 pkg-exim4-users@lists.alioth.debian.org. Please ask Debian-specific
 questions there, and only write to the upstream exim-users mailing
 list if you are sure that your question is not Debian-specific. You
 can find the subscription web page on

Description: SMB/CIFS file, print, and login server for Unix
 Samba is an implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol for Unix systems,
 providing support for cross-platform file and printer sharing with
 Microsoft Windows, OS X, and other Unix systems.  Samba can also function
 as an NT4-style domain controller, and can integrate with both NT4 domains
 and Active Directory realms as a member server.
 .
 This package provides the components necessary to use Samba as a
 stand-alone file and print server.  For use in an NT4 domain or Active
 Directory realm, you will also need the winbind package.
 .
 This package is not required for connecting to existing SMB/CIFS servers
 (see smbclient) or for mounting remote filesystems (see cifs-utils).

 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.

Description: The Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased
 vector-based rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist
 of line segments and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width
 with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with
 optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the
 extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension.
 .
 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the
 significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When
 complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of
 PDF 1.4.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.

Description: Music Player Daemon
 Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a server that allows remote access for
 playing audio files (Ogg-Vorbis, FLAC, MP3, Wave, and AIFF), streams
 (Ogg-Vorbis, MP3) and managing playlists.  Gapless playback, buffered
 output, and crossfading support is also included.  The design focus is
 on integrating a computer into a stereo system that provides control
 for music playback over a TCP/IP network.  The goals are to be easy to

 The daemon is controlled through a client which need not run on the
 same computer mpd runs on.  The separate client and server design
 allows users to choose a user interface that best suites their tastes
 independently of the underlying daemon (this package) which actually

Description: Pluggable Authentication Modules library
 Contains the shared library for Linux-PAM, a library that enables the
 local system administrator to choose how applications authenticate users.
 In other words, without rewriting or recompiling a PAM-aware application,
 it is possible to switch between the authentication mechanism(s) it uses.
 One may entirely upgrade the local authentication system without touching
 the applications themselves.

Description: MP3/Ogg Vorbis broadcast streaming library (development)
 A library for communicating with and sending data to Icecast and Icecast 2
 streaming audio servers.  It handles the socket connection, the timing of
 the data transmission, and prevents bad data from getting to the server.
 .
 With just a few lines of code, a programmer can easily turn any application
 into a streaming source for an Icecast-based server.  Libshout also allows
 developers who want a specific feature set (database access, request taking)
 to concentrate on that feature set, instead of worrying about how server
 communication works.
 .
 This package contains the development headers, static libraries, and source
 code to an example program.

Description: Update Configuration File: preserve user changes to config files.
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Description: Linux Standard Base version reporting utility
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.
 .
 The lsb-release command is a simple tool to help identify the Linux
 distribution being used and its compliance with the Linux Standard Base.
 LSB conformance will not be reported unless the required metapackages are
 installed.
 .
 While it is intended for use by LSB packages, this command may also
 be useful for programmatically distinguishing between a pure Debian
 installation and derived distributions.

Description: Development files for MIT Kerberos without Heimdal conflict
 Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
 Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.  That means that there is a
 third party (the Kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on
 the network (users and services, usually called "principals").
 .
 This is the MIT reference implementation of Kerberos V5.
 .
 Most users wishing to build applications against MIT Kerberos should
 install libkrb5-dev.  However, that package conflicts with heimdal-dev.
 This package installs libraries and headers in /usr/include/mit-krb5 and
 /usr/lib/mit-krb5 and can be installed along side heimdal-multidev, which
 provides the same facilities for Heimdal.

Description: SOAP Support for Python
 This package contains the SOAPpy Python module, which implements a high-
 level interface to Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) functions from
 Python. It includes functionality for acting as a SOAP server, client,
 or proxy, and includes both building and parsing functions. It has been
 tested against a wide array of other SOAP clients and servers, and is a very
 robust and well-rounded implementation of the SOAP protocol.
 .
 SOAPpy is not actively supported by upstream anymore - please do not
 consider to use it in new projects! All functions were merged into ZSI,
 which is available in the python-zsi package, use it instead.

Description: Audio sample rate conversion library
 libsamplerate (aka Secret Rabbit Code) is a library for audio rate conversion.
 .
 libsamplerate currently provides three different sample rate conversion
 algorithms; zero order hold, linear interpolation and FIR filter interpolation
 (using filters derived from the mathematical SINC function). The first two
 algorithms (zero order hold and linear) are included for completeness and are
 not recommended for any application where high quality sample rate conversion
 is required. For the FIR/Sinc algorithm, three converters are provided;
 SRC_SINC_FASTEST, SRC_SINC_MEDIUM_QUALITY and SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY to allow a
 trade off between conversion speed and conversion quality.
 .
 libsamplerate is capable of downsampling to 1/256 of the original sample rate
 and upsampling to 256 times the original sample rate. It is also capable of
 time varying conversions for vary speed effects and synchronising of two
 unlocked sample rates.

 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: JavaScript's functional programming helper library
 Underscore is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides a lot
 of the functional programming support that you would expect in
 Prototype.js (or Ruby), but without extending any of the built-in
 JavaScript objects.  It's the tie to go along with jQuery's tux.
 .
 Underscore provides 60-odd functions that support both the usual
 functional suspects: map, select, invoke - as well as more specialized
 helpers: function binding, javascript templating, deep equality
 testing, and so on.  It delegates to built-in functions, if present, so
 modern browsers will use the native implementations of forEach, map,
 reduce, filter, every, some and indexOf.

Description: Development files for audio sample rate conversion
 libsamplerate (aka Secret Rabbit Code) is a library for audio rate conversion.
 .
 libsamplerate currently provides three different sample rate conversion
 algorithms; zero order hold, linear interpolation and FIR filter interpolation
 (using filters derived from the mathematical SINC function). The first two
 algorithms (zero order hold and linear) are included for completeness and are
 not recommended for any application where high quality sample rate conversion
 is required. For the FIR/Sinc algorithm, three converters are provided;
 SRC_SINC_FASTEST, SRC_SINC_MEDIUM_QUALITY and SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY to allow a
 trade off between conversion speed and conversion quality.
 .
 libsamplerate is capable of downsampling to 1/256 of the original sample rate
 and upsampling to 256 times the original sample rate. It is also capable of
 time varying conversions for vary speed effects and synchronising of two
 unlocked sample rates.
 .
 This package contains the library header files and API documentation.

 .
 It allows you to allocate memory basically as you normally would without
 explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The collector
 automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer be
 used.
 .
 This version of the collector is thread safe, has C++ support and uses the
 defaults for everything else. However, it does not work as a drop-in malloc(3)
 replacement.

Description: Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor
 This package contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an
 implementation of the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for
 full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP
 (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

Description: SELinux library for manipulating binary security policies
 Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number
 of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
 mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
 kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
 improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
 architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
 of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
 based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access
 Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libsepol provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies.
 It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well
 as by programs like load_policy that need to perform specific transformations
 on binary policies such as customizing policy boolean settings.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

Description: ASCII transliterations of Unicode text (Python module)
 It often happens that you have text data in Unicode, but you need to represent
 it in ASCII for display. One could represent non-roman Unicode characters as
 "???" or "\\15BA\\15A0\\1610", but neither is useful to the user reading the
 text.
 .
 Unidecode tries to represent it in ASCII characters (i.e., the universally
 displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F), where the compromises taken
 when mapping between two character sets are chosen to be near what a human
 with a US keyboard would choose.
 .
 This module generally produces better results than simply stripping accents
 from characters (which can be done in Python with built-in functions). It is
 based on hand-tuned character mappings that for example also contain ASCII
 approximations for symbols and non-Latin alphabets.
 .
 unidecode is a Python port of the Text::Unidecode Perl module.

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: report the search path for a class's ISA tree
 Suppose you have a class (like Food::Fish::Fishstick) that is derived, via
 its @ISA, from one or more superclasses (as Food::Fish::Fishstick is from
 Food::Fish, Life::Fungus, and Chemicals), and some of those superclasses may
 themselves each be derived, via its @ISA, from one or more superclasses (as
 above).
 .
 When, then, you call a method in that class ($fishstick->calories), Perl
 first searches there for that method, but if it's not there, it goes
 searching in its superclasses, and so on, in a depth-first (or maybe
 "height-first" is the word) search. In the above example, it'd first look in
 Food::Fish, then Food, then Matter, then Life::Fungus, then Life, then
 Chemicals.
 .
 This library, Class::ISA, provides functions that return that list -- the
 list (in order) of names of classes Perl would search to find a method, with
 no duplicates.

 Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections can use to both
 store and retrieve information on the client side of the connection. For more
 information about cookies refer to
 <URL:http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html> and
 <URL:http://www.cookiecentral.com/>. HTTP::Cookies also implements the new
 style cookies described in RFC 2965. The two variants of cookies are supposed
 to be able to coexist happily.
 .
 Instances of the class HTTP::Cookies are able to store a collection of
 Set-Cookie2: and Set-Cookie: headers and are able to use this information to
 initialize Cookie-headers in HTTP::Request objects. The state of a
 HTTP::Cookies object can be saved in and restored from files.

    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

 for new operating systems, reorganizing disk usage, and copying data
 to new hard disks.
 .
 This package contains the binary and manual page. Further
 documentation is available in parted-doc.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS, and PC98
 partitioning formats, as well as a "loop" (raw disk) type which
 allows use on RAID/LVM. It can detect and remove ASFS/AFFS/APFS,
 Btrfs, ext2/3/4, FAT16/32, HFS, JFS, linux-swap, UFS, XFS, and ZFS
 file systems. Parted also has the ability to create and modify file
 systems of some of these types, but using it to perform file system
 operations is now deprecated.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive
 data loss. While there are no such bugs known at the moment, they
 could exist, so please back up all important files before running
 it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: lightweight C library for daemons - runtime library
 libdaemon is a leightweight C library which eases the writing of UNIX daemons.
 It consists of the following parts:
 .
  * Wrapper around fork() for correct daemonization of a process
  * Wrapper around syslog() for simple log output to syslog or STDERR
  * An API for writing PID files
  * An API for serializing signals into a pipe for use with select() or poll()
  * An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected to syslog
 .
 Routines like these are included in most of the daemon software available. It
 is not simple to get these done right and code duplication is not acceptable.
 .
 This package includes the libdaemon run time shared library.

  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

 /etc/wgetrc 12cbbf1f2f88dc3b0b289cd368761b7e
Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: module to parse directory listings
 File::Listing exports a single function called parse_dir(), which can be used
 to parse directory listings.
 .
 The first parameter to parse_dir() is the directory listing to parse. It can
 be a scalar, a reference to an array of directory lines or a glob
 representing a filehandle to read the directory listing from.
 .
 The second parameter is the time zone to use when parsing time stamps in the
 listing. If this value is undefined, then the local time zone is assumed.
 .
 The third parameter is the type of listing to assume. Currently supported
 formats are 'unix', 'apache' and 'dosftp'. The default value 'unix'.

Description: a pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and
 processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. Mawk
 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: Save/restore system clock on machines without working RTC hardware
 Some machines don't have a working realtime clock (RTC) unit, or no
 driver for the hardware that does exist. fake-hwclock is a simple set
 of scripts to save the kernel's current clock periodically (including
 at shutdown) and restore it at boot so that the system clock keeps at
 least close to realtime. This will stop some of the problems that may
 be caused by a system believing it has travelled in time back to
 1970, such as needing to perform filesystem checks at every boot.
 .
 On top of this, use of NTP is still recommended to deal with the fake
 clock "drifting" while the hardware is halted or rebooting.

Description: GNU privacy guard - a free PGP replacement
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC 4880.
 .
 GnuPG 1.4 is the standalone, non-modularized series. In contrast to
 the version 2 series, shipped with the gnupg2 package, it comes
 with no support for S/MIME and some other tools useful for desktop
 environments, but also with less dependencies.
 .
 The gnupg package is built without libcurl. So it does not support
 HKPS keyservers. Install the gnupg-curl package if you want to use
 the keyserver helper tools built with libcurl and supporting HKPS.
 .
 GnuPG does not use any patented algorithms. This means it cannot be
 compatible with PGP2, because that uses IDEA (which is patented in
 a number of countries).

Description: simple http server class
 Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a
 socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of
 IO::Socket::INET, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.
 .
 The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
 The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is
 another IO::Socket::INET subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this
 object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The
 ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.
 .
 This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of
 the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note
 that the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the
 HTTP/1.1 protocol.

Description: automatically mount and unmount USB mass storage devices
 This package automatically mounts USB mass storage devices (typically
 USB pens) when they are plugged in, and unmounts them when they are
 removed. The mountpoints (/media/usb[0-7] by default), filesystem types
 to consider, and mount options are configurable. When multiple devices
 are plugged in, the first available mountpoint is automatically
 selected. If the device provides a model name, a symbolic link
 /var/run/usbmount/MODELNAME pointing to the mountpoint is automatically
 created.
 .
 The script that does the mounting is called by the udev daemon.
 Therefore, USBmount requires a 2.6 (or newer) Linux kernel.
 .
 Firewire devices are also supported by USBmount.
 .
 USBmount is intended as a lightweight solution which is independent of
 a desktop environment. Users which would like an icon to appear when an
 USB device is plugged in should use the pmount and hal packages
 instead.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: global hotkey daemon for Linux
 Triggerhappy watches connected input devices for certain key presses
 or other input events and runs administrator-configured
 commands when they occur. Unlike other hotkey daemons, it runs as a
 persistent, systemwide service and therefore can be used even
 outside the context of a user or X11 session.
 .
 It can handle a wide variety of devices (keyboards, joysticks,
 wiimote, etc.), as long as they are presented by the kernel as
 generic input devices. No kernel patch is required. The daemon is
 a userspace program that polls the /dev/input/event? interfaces
 for incoming key, button and switch events. A single daemon can
 monitor multiple input devices and can dynamically add additional
 ones. Hotkey handlers can be assigned to dedicated (tagged) devices
 or globally.
 .
 For example, this package might be useful on a headless system to
 use input events generated by a remote control to control an
 mpd server, but can also be used to allow the adjustment of audio
 and network status on a notebook without relying on user specific
 configuration.
 .
 Key combinations are supported as well as the hotplugging of devices
 using a udev hotplug script; the running daemon can also be influenced
 by a client program, e.g. to temporarily pause the processing of
 events or switch to a different set of hotkey bindings.

Description: quickly find files on the filesystem based on their name
 mlocate is a new implementation of locate, a tool to find files
 anywhere in the filesystem based on their name, using a fixed pattern
 or a regular expression. Unlike other tools like find(1), locate uses
 a previously created database to perform the search, allowing queries
 to execute much faster. This database is updated periodically from
 cron.
 .
 Several implementations of locate exist: the original implementation
 from GNU's findutils, slocate, and mlocate. The advantages of mlocate
 are:
 .
  * it indexes all the filesystem, but results of a search will only
    include files that the user running locate has access to. It does
    this by updating the database as root, but making it unreadable for
    normal users, who can only access it via the locate binary. slocate
    does this as well, but not the original locate.
 .
  * instead of re-reading all the contents of all directories each time
    the database is updated, mlocate keeps timestamp information in its
    database and can know if the contents of a directory changed without
    reading them again. This makes updates much faster and less demanding
    on the hard drive. This feature is only found in mlocate.
 .
 Installing mlocate will change the /usr/bin/locate binary to point to
 mlocate via the alternatives mechanism. After installation, you may
 wish to run /etc/cron.daily/mlocate by hand to create the database,
 otherwise mlocate won't work until that script is run from cron itself
 (since mlocate does not use the same database file as standard locate).
 Also, you may wish to remove the "locate" package in order not to have
 two different database files updated regularly on your system.

Description: Avahi's embeddable mDNS/DNS-SD library
 Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery.
 It allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts
 running on a local network with no specific configuration. For
 example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to
 print to, files to look at and people to talk to.
 .
 This package contains the library for Avahi's embeddable mDNS/DNS-SD stack.
 This can be used by embedded applications to integrate mDNS/DNS-SD
 functionality into their applications.
 .
 You should not however use this library for non-embedded applications, you
 should use libavahi-client which interacts with the avahi daemon.

Description: HTTPS driver for LWP::UserAgent
 The LWP::Protocol::https module provide support for using HTTPS schemed URLs
 with LWP. LWP::Protocol::https is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling, so
 you don't use it directly. Once the module is installed LWP is able to access
 sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.
 .
 If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and
 neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be
 the one provided by ca-certificates.
 .
 This module used to be bundled with the libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in
 v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN
 tool-chain. Applications that need HTTPS support can just declare their
 dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what
 underlying modules to install.

Description: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

Description: International Ispell (an interactive spelling corrector)
 Ispell corrects spelling in plain text, LaTeX, sgml/html/xml, and nroff files.
 [x]Emacs and jed have nice interfaces to ispell, and ispell works from many
 other tools and from the command line as well.
 .
 No ispell dictionaries are included in this package; you must install
 at least one of them ("iamerican" is recommended by default for no good
 reason); install the "ispell-dictionary" package(s) for the language(s)
 you and your users will want to spell-check.
 .
 It's a good idea to install "word list" package(s) for the same language(s),
 because they'll be used by ispell's (L)ookup command.

Description: secure shell (SSH) server, for secure access from remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the sshd server.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 sshd replaces the insecure rshd program, which is obsolete for most
 purposes.

Description: boot sequence organizer using LSB init.d script dependency information
 The insserv program is used by the standard SysV-based init system. It
 updates the order of symlinks in /etc/rc?.d/ based on dependencies
 specified by LSB headers in the init.d scripts themselves.
 .
 These declared relations between scripts make it possible to optimize
 the boot sequence for the currently installed set of packages, while
 detecting and rejecting dependency loops.
 .
 Using insserv incorrectly can result in an unbootable system.

 change events, event watchers dealing with the event loop itself, file
 watchers, and even limited support for fork events. It uses a priority
 queue to manage timers and uses arrays as fundamental data structure. It
 has no artificial limitations on the number of watchers waiting for the
 same event.
 .
 libev supports select, poll, epoll, kqueue, and inotify.

Version: 1.03-1

Description: utility to determine the locale encoding
 In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
 processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte
 based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program
 from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
 .
 The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
 requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.
 The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET
 in the locale jargon) and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding
 under the name "locale". It means bytes obtained from the environment can be
 converted to Unicode strings by calling Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) and
 converted back again with Encode::decode(locale => $string).

 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: fast, scalable, distributed revision control system
 Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large
 projects with speed and efficiency; it is used for many high profile
 open source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.
 .
 Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools.
 Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full
 revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a
 central server.
 .
 This package provides the git main components with minimal dependencies.
 Additional functionality, e.g. a graphical user interface and revision
 tree visualizer, tools for interoperating with other VCS's, or a web
 interface, is provided as separate git* packages.

Description: Tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from
 files called `Makefile.am'.
 .
 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
 from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back
 of the Automake maintainer).
 .
 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
 (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
 `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
 .
 Automake 1.11 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake
 1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10 did, so has been renamed so that the
 previous version can continue to be made available.

Description: process scheduling daemon
 The cron daemon is a background process that runs particular programs at
 particular times (for example, every minute, day, week, or month), as
 specified in a crontab. By default, users may also create crontabs of
 their own so that processes are run on their behalf.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package does not provide any system maintenance tasks. Basic
 periodic maintenance tasks are provided by other packages, such
 as checksecurity.

 This package provides the shared libraries for Security-enhanced
 Linux that provides interfaces (e.g. library functions for the
 SELinux kernel APIs like getcon(), other support functions like

 Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number of utilities with
 enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access
 controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new
 architectural components originally developed to improve the security
 of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide
 general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access
 control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type
 Enforcement, Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libselinux1 provides an API for SELinux applications to get and set
 process and file security contexts and to obtain security policy
 decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux
 API. libselinux may use the shared libsepol to manipulate the binary
 policy if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the policy format to an older
 version supported by the kernel) when loading policy.

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

 Tagged collections are collections of items tagged with multiple categories.
 libtagcoll provides general infrastructure to handle tagged collection data,
 plus various kind of tagged collection manipulation functions:
 .
  * apply various kinds of transformations to the collection;
  * generate and apply tag patches;
  * discover and show implicit hierarchical relationships between
    tags;
  * organize the collection in an intuitively navigable hierarchy.
  * keep an on-disk index of the tag data
 .
 Warning: the API has not yet been stabilized and is subject to change in
 future versions.  This is why the library is distributed in a -dev package
 only.

Description: support files for all Exim MTA (v4) packages
 Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-base provides the support
 files needed by all exim4 daemon packages. You need an additional package
 containing the main executable. The available packages are:
 .
  exim4-daemon-light
  exim4-daemon-heavy
 .
 If you build exim4 from the source package locally, you can also
 build an exim4-daemon-custom package tailored to your own feature set.
 .
 The Debian exim4 packages have their own web page,
 http://wiki.debian.org/PkgExim4. There is also a Debian-specific
 FAQ list. Information about the way the Debian packages are
 configured can be found in
 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/README.Debian.gz, which additionally contains
 information about the way the Debian binary packages are built. The
 very extensive upstream documentation is shipped in
 /usr/share/doc/exim4-base/spec.txt.gz. To repeat the debconf-driven
 configuration process in a standard setup, invoke dpkg-reconfigure
 exim4-config. There is a Debian-centered mailing list,
 pkg-exim4-users@lists.alioth.debian.org. Please ask Debian-specific
 questions there, and only write to the upstream exim-users mailing
 list if you are sure that your question is not Debian-specific. You

 GNU Make is an utility which controls the generation of executables and
 other target files of a program from the program's source files. It
 determines automatically which pieces of a large program need to be

 limited to programs and executable, it can be applied to any task
 where a set of target files must be created based on a set of input
 files, based on dependency and processing rules. Indeed, Make is a
 general purpose dependency solver.

Description: a macro processing language
 GNU `m4' is an implementation of the traditional UNIX macro
 processor.  It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some
 extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to
 macros).  `m4' also has builtin functions for including files, running
 shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.  Autoconf needs GNU `m4' for
 generating `configure' scripts, but not for running them.

Description: ISC DHCP client
 This is the client from the Internet Software Consortium's implementation of
 DHCP. For more information visit http://www.isc.org.
 .
 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol like BOOTP
 (actually dhcpd includes much of the functionality of bootpd). It
 gives client machines "leases" for IP addresses and can
 automatically set their network configuration. If your machine
 depends on DHCP (especially likely if it's a workstation on a large
 network, or a laptop, or attached to a cable modem), keep this or
 another DHCP client installed.

Description: Reclaim disk space removing unneeded localizations
 This is a script to recover disk space wasted for unneeded locales,
 Gnome/KDE localizations and localized man pages. Depending on the
 installation, it is possible to save some 200, 300, or even more
 mega bytes of disk space dedicated for localization you will most
 probably never have any use for. It is run automagically upon
 completion of any apt installation actions.
 .
 Please note, that this tool is a hack which is *not* integrated with
 Debian's package management system and therefore is not for the faint
 of heart. This program interferes with the Debian package management
 and does provoke strange, but usually harmless, behaviour of programs
 related with apt/dpkg like dpkg-repack, reportbug, etc.
 Responsibility for its usage and possible breakage of your system
 therefore lies in the sysadmin's (your) hands.
 .
 Please definitely do abstain from reporting any such bugs blaming
 localepurge if you break your system by using it. If you don't know
 what you are doing and can't handle any resulting breakage on your own
 then please simply don't use this package.
